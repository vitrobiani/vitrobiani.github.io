    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This is an interpreter written in python for a programing languages class.</p>

    <h3>What Does It Do</h3>
    <p>This interpreter acts sort of like most other interpreted languages (such as python). </p>
    <p>You can use it as interpreter to write line by line commands (like python or bash),
        and you can also use it like a "compiler" to feed it a code document (ending in .lambda)
        and it will interpret it line by line (not exactly compiling but close enough).

    <p>The project was written in pycharm and so the environment is best suited for that if 
        you wish to pull the repo from github.
        But, it should work in any environment so long you download the dependencies.
    </p>

    <h3>download PLY</h3>
    <p>For Debian based systems: (Ubuntu, Popos etc.)</p>
    <pre><code>$ sudo apt install python3-ply</code></pre>


    <p>For nix</p>
    <p>Just add this to your nix config or home-manager, or open a nix-shell</p>
    <pre><code>// For config
  environment.systemPackages = [
    pkgs.python312Packages.ply
  ];
// home-manager
  home.packages = [
    pkgs.python312Packages.ply
  ];
// nix-shell in the commandline
  nix-shell -p python312Packages.ply</code></pre>

  <h3>Download the executable</h3>
  <p>You could also simply download the executable from github or from here:</p>
